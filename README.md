## storm-control ##
This is a repository of code developed in the [Zhuang Lab](http://zhuang.harvard.edu) for the acquisition of STORM movies.

The is located in the storm_control folder.

## Installation ##
You will need Python and PyQt as well as a number of other libraries. Please see the Install.txt file in the hal4000 folder.

## General notes ##
1. This software is written primarily in Python with a few C helper libraries.

2. Some Doxygen documentation is available (for Dave, HAL and Steve), but you'll have to run doxygen to create it.

3. The software is provided "as is" in the hope that others might find it useful. While it is fairly stable and has been developed and used since 2009 in the Zhuang lab, we provide no guarantee that any future changes that are made will maintain backwards compatibility with older versions.

4. We can only provide fairly limited support. You will probably have the most success adapting this software for your purposes if you are reasonably familiar with the Python programming language.

5. Questions should be addressed to Hazen Babcock (hbabcock _at_ fas.harvard.edu).
