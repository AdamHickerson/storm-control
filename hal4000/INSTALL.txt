(1) Install Dependencies:
 (a) Mingw
 (b) Python
 (c) PyQt
 (d) pywin32
 (e) numpy (for the optimal focus lock mode)
 (f) scipy (for the optimal focus lock mode)


(2) Compile UI elements (in the qtdesigner folder):
 With PyQt you should get a program installed called pyuic.py. Typically
 it can be found in PythonXY\lib\site-packages\pyqt4\uic\. You use it
 like this pyuic.py asdf.ui > asdf.py. You'll need to compile all of the
 following:

 (a) camera-params-v1.ui > camera_params_v1.py
 (b) camera-v1.ui > camera_v1.py
 (c) focuslock-v1.ui > focuslock.py
 (d) hal-4000-v1.ui > hal_4000ui_v1.py
 (e) illumination-v1.ui > illumination_v1.py
 (f) spotcounter-v2.ui > spotcounterui_v1.py
 (g) stage-v1.ui > stageui_v1.py
 (h) progression-v1.ui > progressionui_v1.py


(3) Compile C helper libraries:
 Instructions on how to compile the libraries are in the library headers.
 (a) andor/format_converters.c
 (b) objectFinder/MedianCounter.c
 (c) phreshPhotonics/averager.c (only if you are using their QPD).
 (d) focusLock/focus_quality.c (for optimal focus lock mode)


(4) Verify that the software works:
 The settings_default.xml file contains all the options related to program
 setup and etc. As a first step to verify that the software runs absent
 any hardware issues do the following:

 (a) Set setup_name to none

 Then, in the folder where the hal-4000.py file is located type 
 "python hal-4000.py" to run the program. With these settings the software 
 should start without any warning messages and display a simple pattern in 
 the camera view area.


(5) Modifying to work with your hardware:
 This is the hard part as it is of course hardware dependent. Python classes
 for control of the hardware that is available in our lab can be found in
 folders that are named (more or less) by the manufacturer of the hardware.
 
 In addition there are the following folders:
 (1) Camera - Classes for camera control, image display & parameter display.
 (2) focuslock - Classes for focus lock control.
 (3) illumination - Classes for illumination & shuttering.
 (4) stagecontrol - Classes for controlling a motorized XY stage.

 In these folders you will see files/Classes that start with a machine name, 
 e.g. storm3IlluminationControl or noneIlluminationControl. You will need to
 create your own version of the files specialized to interface with your
 specific hardware.
